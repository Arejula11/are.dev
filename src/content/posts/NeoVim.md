Last week, we explored [Vim](https://are-dev.es/posts/vim); a fast, keyboard-driven text editor that’s loved (and sometimes feared) by developers around the world. This week, we’re taking things a step further and diving into Neovim, a modern evolution of Vim that brings the same power and efficiency into today’s workflows.

Neovim takes the foundation of Vim and enhances it with modern features, better extensibility, and a cleaner configuration system. It’s not a complete rewrite; rather, it’s a thoughtful reimagining of what Vim could be with a bit of modernization.

If Vim is like a vintage sports car, reliable, fast and full of character, Neovim is the tuned-up version with a smoother engine, updated dashboard and better handling. You still get the same thrill, but with all the modern comforts developers expect today.

By the end, you’ll understand why so many developers are making the switch from Vim to Neovim — and how you can take advantage of its modern features to boost your productivity.


## What Is Neovim?

Neovim is a modern, open-source text editor built as an improvement and extension of Vim. It was created to address some of the limitations of Vim’s architecture while preserving its core philosophy of efficiency and keyboard-driven editing.

At its core, Neovim is still Vim; it uses the same commands, modes and editing philosophy. If you already know how to move around and edit text in Vim, you’ll feel right at home in Neovim. But under the hood, it introduces some important changes that make it more flexible and future-ready.

Here’s what sets Neovim apart:

### Modern Architecture

Vim’s codebase had grown difficult to extend over time. Neovim rebuilt large parts of it to make the editor more modular and plugin-friendly. That means new features can be added more easily without breaking everything else.

### Asynchronous Plugins

In Neovim, plugins can run asynchronously, meaning they don’t freeze the editor while running background tasks like linting, formatting or autocompletion. This makes the whole experience smoother and more responsive.

### Better Integration with Modern Tools

Neovim integrates seamlessly with Language Server Protocols (LSP), Tree-sitter for syntax highlighting and modern plugin managers. These features turn it into a true coding environment rather than just a text editor.

### Active Development and Community

While Vim is still maintained, Neovim has a very active open-source community constantly pushing updates, adding integrations and refining the experience. This means faster development and more innovation.

In short, Neovim takes the timeless principles of Vim, efficiency, control, and keyboard-driven editing, and adapts them for modern development needs. It’s the same philosophy, but redesigned for today’s workflows.


## Installing Neovim

Getting started with Neovim is simple, and just like Vim, it’s available on all major platforms. You can install it on Linux, macOS, or Windows in just a few steps.


### Linux

Most Linux distributions include Neovim in their repositories. To check if it’s already installed, run:

```bash
nvim --version
```

If you see version information, you’re all set. Otherwise, install it using your package manager:

```bash
sudo apt install neovim       # Ubuntu / Debian
sudo dnf install neovim       # Fedora
sudo pacman -S neovim         # Arch
```

For the latest version, you can also use AppImage or install from the official [Neovim GitHub page](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases).



### macOS

You can install Neovim with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), which makes setup quick and easy:

```bash
brew install neovim
```

Once installed, open it from your terminal with:

```bash
nvim
```

If you prefer, you can also download pre-built binaries or use MacPorts, but Homebrew is usually the simplest option.



### Windows

Neovim works great on Windows, too. You can install it using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/):

```bash
choco install neovim
```

or

```bash
scoop install neovim
```

Alternatively, you can grab the latest *.zip* file from the [official release page](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases) and add it to your system’s PATH.

To open Neovim, run:

```bash
nvim
```

in PowerShell or Command Prompt.



### First Launch

When you open Neovim for the first time, you’ll notice it looks very similar to Vim, a blank screen waiting for input. That’s because Neovim retains Vim’s modal editing system. You can use all the same basic commands (`i`, `:wq`, `dd`, etc.) right away.

However, the real fun begins when you start customizing it and adding plugins, something Neovim makes much easier than Vim.

## Key Features That Make Neovim Stand Out

At first glance, Neovim looks almost identical to Vim; the same interface, the same commands and the same editing modes. But once you start using it, you’ll notice that Neovim feels faster, smoother and more capable.


### Built-in LSP (Language Server Protocol) Support

Neovim has native LSP support, which brings IDE-like features such as autocompletion, go-to-definition and inline diagnostics directly into your editor, no heavy extensions required.

With a few lines of configuration, you can connect Neovim to any modern language server and enjoy the same smart code intelligence that you’d expect from editors like VS Code.


### Tree-sitter for Better Syntax Highlighting

Tree-sitter is a modern parsing library that gives Neovim precise, context-aware syntax highlighting. Instead of relying on old regex-based highlighting, Tree-sitter understands the structure of your code. The result is cleaner, faster and more accurate coloring, especially for large or complex files.


### Lua-Based Configuration

One of the biggest upgrades from Vimscript is that Neovim can be fully configured using Lua, a lightweight programming language that’s easier to read, faster and far more flexible.

This change makes it simpler to write and organize your config files and it has opened the door for an entire ecosystem of Lua-based plugins that are faster and more maintainable than older Vimscript ones.


### Modern Plugin Ecosystem

Neovim’s plugin community is thriving. There are plugins for everything; file explorers, fuzzy finders, Git integration, debugging, code formatting and more. Tools like Telescope, nvim-tree and Lualine have become must-haves for many developers.

And with plugin managers like lazy.nvim or packer.nvim, installing and updating plugins is quick and painless.


Perfect — this is where Neovim really shines, so an in-depth section makes total sense. Below is a **detailed, structured “Customizing Neovim”** section. It’s designed to help beginners build a solid understanding while keeping the tone approachable and hands-on, just like your Vim post.

## Customizing Neovim

Neovim’s biggest strength is how customizable it is. Unlike traditional editors, where you’re limited to whatever settings are available in a menu, Neovim lets you shape the editor exactly the way you want; from the way it looks, to the keybindings, to the tools it integrates with.

If Vim gave you power through efficiency, Neovim gives you power through control.

Let’s explore how to make Neovim feel like *your* editor using Lua and *lazy.nvim*.


### Configuration Basics

When you first install Neovim, it doesn’t come heavily configured, and that’s a good thing. You get a clean slate to build on.

Neovim stores its configuration files in a specific directory depending on your operating system:

* **Linux / macOS:**
  `~/.config/nvim/`
* **Windows:**
  `C:\Users\<your-user>\AppData\Local\nvim\`

Inside that folder, create a file called:

```
init.lua
```

This file replaces Vim’s *.vimrc* and allows you to write your configuration in Lua, which is faster and easier to maintain than Vimscript.


### Setting Up a Plugin Manager

One of Neovim’s greatest strengths is its modern plugin ecosystem.
To manage plugins easily, you’ll need a plugin manager. Two of the most popular options are:

* [*packer.nvim*](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) – Lua-based, lightweight, and widely used.
* [*lazy.nvim*](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) – A newer, fast-loading plugin manager with built-in performance optimizations.

For this guide, we’ll use *lazy.nvim* due to its speed and simplicity.
### Your First Neovim Configuration

Here’s a minimal but complete example to get you started:

```lua
-- Basic settings
vim.opt.number = true
vim.opt.relativenumber = true
vim.opt.tabstop = 4
vim.opt.shiftwidth = 4
vim.opt.expandtab = true
vim.opt.termguicolors = true
vim.opt.mouse = "a"

-- Leader key
vim.g.mapleader = " "

-- Keymaps
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>w", ":w<CR>", { desc = "Save file" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>q", ":q<CR>", { desc = "Quit" })

-- Plugin manager (lazy.nvim)
local lazypath = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/lazy/lazy.nvim"
if not vim.loop.fs_stat(lazypath) then
  vim.fn.system({
    "git", "clone", "--filter=blob:none",
    "https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git",
    "--branch=stable", lazypath
  })
end
vim.opt.rtp:prepend(lazypath)

require("lazy").setup({
  { "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", dependencies = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" } },
  { "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter", build = ":TSUpdate" },
  { "neovim/nvim-lspconfig" },
  { "hrsh7th/nvim-cmp", dependencies = { "hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp", "hrsh7th/cmp-buffer" } },
  { "nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim" },
  { "EdenEast/nightfox.nvim" }
})

-- Theme
vim.cmd[[colorscheme Dayfox]]

-- Statusline
require("lualine").setup()
```

You can copy and paste this code into your *init.lua* file to get a basic Neovim setup with essential plugins and sensible defaults. You will get this: 

![Neovim with plugins](/assets/neovim-config.png)

### Breaking It Down

Let’s unpack what’s happening here:

#### 1. **Basic Settings**

This section tweaks the most common editor preferences — enabling line numbers, using spaces instead of tabs, enabling colors, and making the mouse usable.

These lines make Neovim feel a bit more like a modern text editor right away.

#### 2. **Leader Key**

```lua
vim.g.mapleader = " "
```

The “leader key” acts as a prefix for your custom shortcuts.
By setting it to space (`" "`), you can easily define intuitive keymaps — for example:

* *Space + w* → Save file
* *Space + q* → Quit

#### 3. **Installing `lazy.nvim`**

*lazy.nvim* is a fast and modern plugin manager written in Lua.
This code checks if it’s installed — and if not, automatically downloads it from GitHub the first time you launch Neovim.
Once loaded, you can declare your plugins inside *require("lazy").setup()*.

#### 4. **Essential Plugins**

Let’s see what each plugin does:

| Plugin            | Description                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *telescope.nvim*  | A fuzzy finder that lets you quickly search files, buffers, and text.                                   |
| *nvim-treesitter* | Provides better syntax highlighting and code structure awareness.                                       |
| *nvim-lspconfig*  | Enables Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration — autocompletion, diagnostics, and go-to-definition. |
| *nvim-cmp*        | A completion engine that works with LSP and other sources.                                              |
| *lualine.nvim*    | A modern and minimal status line.                                                                       |
| *nightfox.nvim*   | A beautiful and performance-friendly colorscheme.                                                       |

#### 5. **Applying the Theme**

```lua
vim.cmd[[colorscheme Dayfox]]
```

This activates the Dayfox theme (part of the Nightfox collection). You can easily switch to other options like *nightfox*, *dawnfox*, or *nordfox* for a different mood.

#### 6. **Status Line Setup**

```lua
require("lualine").setup()
```

This loads the *lualine* status bar at the bottom, showing file info, current mode, and more. It’s clean, useful, and highly customizable.


### Installing and Updating Plugins

Once you save your *init.lua*, open Neovim and run:

```
:Lazy sync
```

This will automatically download and install all your defined plugins.
To update them later, just run:

```
:Lazy update
```


### Extending Your Setup

From here, you can continue expanding your configuration — here are a few ideas to grow your setup gradually:

* Add **file explorer** support with [*nvim-tree.lua*](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua).
* Integrate **Git tools** like [*gitsigns.nvim*](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim).
* Improve autocompletion with snippets (*L3MON4D3/LuaSnip*).
* Customize your status line or theme further.

Neovim gives you complete freedom to decide what your editor should look like and how it should behave.


## Making Neovim Yours: Custom Configuration & Personalization

Now that you have Neovim up and running with a few essential plugins, it’s time to make it truly yours.
Customization is where Neovim really shines, every part of it can be tuned to fit your workflow, preferences, and style.

Let’s go over some of the most common ways to personalize your setup with practical examples.


### 1. Custom Keybindings

Keybindings are at the heart of the Vim/Neovim experience. You already have a few shortcuts for saving and quitting, but you can map any command or plugin action to any key combination.

In your *init.lua*, you can define mappings like this:

```lua
-- General shortcuts
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>e", ":Ex<CR>", { desc = "Open file explorer" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>h", ":nohlsearch<CR>", { desc = "Clear search highlights" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>n", ":enew<CR>", { desc = "New file" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>r", ":source %<CR>", { desc = "Reload current config" })
```

A few things to note:

* *"n"* means it’s for *normal mode*.
* *<leader>* is the leader key you defined earlier (in your case, the spacebar).
* *desc* adds a helpful description shown by some plugins like *which-key.nvim*.

You can even map plugin actions, for example, with Telescope:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>ff", ":Telescope find_files<CR>", { desc = "Find files" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>fg", ":Telescope live_grep<CR>", { desc = "Search text" })
```

And for the file explorer (*nvim-tree* if you install it later):

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>t", ":NvimTreeToggle<CR>", { desc = "Toggle file tree" })
```

Custom keymaps are where Neovim really becomes efficient, you can design a workflow that fits your exact habits.


### 2. Changing and Exploring Themes

Neovim has a huge variety of color schemes, and with *lazy.nvim*, switching between them is as easy as changing one line.

You’re currently using Dayfox, one of the themes in the Nightfox collection.
To explore others, try switching in your config:

```lua
vim.cmd[[colorscheme nightfox]]     -- Dark
vim.cmd[[colorscheme dawnfox]]      -- Light
vim.cmd[[colorscheme nordfox]]      -- Cool tones
vim.cmd[[colorscheme terafox]]      -- Soft blue-gray
```

If you want to try something new, add another theme plugin via lazy:

```lua
{ "folke/tokyonight.nvim" },
{ "ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim" },
{ "catppuccin/nvim", name = "catppuccin" }
```

Then load it:

```lua
vim.cmd[[colorscheme catppuccin]]
```

Experiment with a few until you find one that feels right, your color scheme can dramatically change the vibe of your workspace.


### 3. Fine-Tuning the Interface

Neovim’s UI can be adjusted to feel more like a modern IDE. Here are a few tweaks you can add:

```lua
-- Show a vertical line at column 80
vim.opt.colorcolumn = "80"

-- Always show the sign column (useful for Git/LSP indicators)
vim.opt.signcolumn = "yes"

-- Highlight the current line
vim.opt.cursorline = true

-- Keep some context when scrolling
vim.opt.scrolloff = 8
```

These small changes make editing more comfortable, especially for long coding sessions.


### 4. Improving Navigation

You can make moving between files, buffers, and splits smoother with a few extra mappings:

```lua
-- Navigate between split windows easily
vim.keymap.set("n", "<C-h>", "<C-w>h", { desc = "Move left" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<C-l>", "<C-w>l", { desc = "Move right" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<C-j>", "<C-w>j", { desc = "Move down" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<C-k>", "<C-w>k", { desc = "Move up" })

-- Cycle through buffers
vim.keymap.set("n", "<Tab>", ":bnext<CR>", { desc = "Next buffer" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<S-Tab>", ":bprevious<CR>", { desc = "Previous buffer" })
```

These shortcuts are great if you work with multiple files open at once.


### 5. Customizing the Status Line (lualine)

You already have *lualine* set up, let’s make it a bit more personal.

Here’s an example configuration you can extend:

```lua
require('lualine').setup({
  options = {
    theme = 'auto',
    section_separators = '',
    component_separators = ''
  },
  sections = {
    lualine_a = {'mode'},
    lualine_b = {'branch', 'diff'},
    lualine_c = {'filename'},
    lualine_x = {'encoding', 'filetype'},
    lualine_y = {'progress'},
    lualine_z = {'location'}
  }
})
```

You can choose a theme that matches your color scheme or even customize the layout of sections.


### 6. Personalizing Behavior

Here are some extra quality-of-life tweaks many users enjoy:

```lua
-- Show hidden files when browsing
vim.opt.hidden = true

-- Enable system clipboard integration
vim.opt.clipboard = "unnamedplus"

-- Automatically reload files changed outside Neovim
vim.opt.autoread = true

-- Highlight yanked text (like VS Code’s copy highlight)
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextYankPost", {
  callback = function() vim.highlight.on_yank({ timeout = 200 }) end
})
```

These small settings make Neovim more seamless and *modern* in day-to-day use.


### 7. Organizing Your Config

As your setup grows, you might not want everything in one file. You can split your configuration into folders and files:

```
~/.config/nvim/
├── init.lua
└── lua/
    ├── settings.lua
    ├── keymaps.lua
    ├── plugins.lua
    └── lsp.lua
```

Then load them in *init.lua*:

```lua
require("settings")
require("keymaps")
require("plugins")
require("lsp")
```

This helps keep your configuration clean and easy to maintain over time.


### 8. Testing and Reloading Your Config

Whenever you edit your configuration, you can reload it without restarting Neovim:

```
:source %
```

Or use your shortcut from earlier:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>r", ":source %<CR>", { desc = "Reload config" })
```

This makes experimenting easy, tweak something, reload and see the result instantly.


With just these examples, you can already build a personalized Neovim setup that feels fast, modern, and completely your own. The best part is: it grows with you. As you learn more, you’ll keep discovering small improvements and plugins that make your workflow even smoother.

## Tips for Mastering Neovim & Next Steps

By now, you’ve got a powerful and personalized Neovim setup; one that’s faster, more modern, and tailored to how *you* like to work.
But as with Vim, mastering Neovim takes time. It’s a tool that rewards curiosity and consistency. The more you use it, the faster and more natural it becomes.

Here are a few practical tips to help you go from beginner to comfortable user:


### 1. Practice the Basics Every Day

Even though Neovim can do everything a modern IDE can, its power still lies in Vim’s editing philosophy, modal editing and efficient keyboard movement.
Keep practicing commands like:

* *dd* – delete a line
* *yy* – copy (yank) a line
* *p* – paste
* *u* – undo
* *Ctrl + r* – redo
* */* – search

The more they become muscle memory, the less you’ll ever need to touch your mouse again.

### 2. Learn by Tweaking Your Config

Don’t treat your configuration as something fixed, it’s meant to evolve.
Try adding one small feature at a time:

* A new keymap that saves you clicks
* A new plugin that improves navigation
* A visual tweak that feels better on your eyes

Every small improvement teaches you something new about how Neovim works.


### 3. Explore the Plugin Ecosystem

There’s a plugin for almost everything:

* **Git integration** – *lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim*
* **File navigation** – *nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua* or *nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim*
* **Debugging** – *mfussenegger/nvim-dap*
* **Markdown preview** – *iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim*

You don’t need them all, but discovering plugins that genuinely fit your workflow can make Neovim feel like a completely new editor.


### 4. Stay Curious

Neovim’s community is incredibly active. Check out:

* The official docs: *:help nvim* (surprisingly readable once you get used to it)
* The [Neovim subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/)
* YouTube channels and GitHub repos sharing dotfiles and walkthroughs

Seeing how other developers customize their setup is one of the best ways to learn.


### 5. Be Patient

Neovim has a learning curve, just like Vim, but it’s one of the most rewarding tools you can master as a developer. Every keypress saved adds up, and soon you’ll find yourself moving faster and thinking less about your tools.


### Wrapping Up

Neovim isn’t just a newer version of Vim, it’s a reimagined editor built for today’s workflows. With built-in LSP, Lua configuration and an ever-growing plugin ecosystem, it offers Vim’s timeless efficiency with modern power and polish.


Happy coding!
