Visual Studio Code (VS Code) has become my go-to code editor due to its versatility, extensive extension ecosystem, and intuitive interface. Over time, I have explored various features and discovered that mastering keyboard shortcuts significantly boosts my productivity.  

I have used VS Code with different operating systems but primarily on macOS. While the editor allows for customizing key bindings, I prefer to stick to the default shortcuts as they are well-thought-out and efficient.  

In this post, I want to share a curated list of my favorite VS Code shortcuts — the ones I rely on every day. Whether you're a beginner aiming to streamline your workflow or an experienced developer looking to pick up a few new tricks, I hope you'll find this collection useful.
